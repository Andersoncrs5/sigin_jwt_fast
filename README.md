# A Simple Login System with JWT in FastAPI

This project is a robust and scalable login system built with FastAPI, designed to serve as a foundational backend for web applications. It implements modern security and architectural principles to ensure reliability and maintainability.

# Core Features
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Securely manages user sessions using JSON Web Tokens. It includes a complete workflow for user registration, login, and token refresh, ensuring a seamless and protected user experience.

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensures code quality and reliability with a strong focus on testing. The project includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Validates individual components in isolation, such as service and repository logic.

- **Integration Tests**: Verifies that different parts of the application, like API routes and database interactions, work correctly together.

- **Data Validation**: Utilizes Pydantic for rigorous input validation, preventing common security vulnerabilities and ensuring that all data conforms to a predefined schema.

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Employs PostgreSQL as the primary database, providing a powerful, reliable, and production-ready solution for data persistence.

- **SOLID Principles**: Developed with a focus on SOLID architectural principles, which promotes a clean, decoupled, and highly maintainable codebase.
